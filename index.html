    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
       I am a Data Scientist & AI Developer with strong hands-on experience in building real-world machine learning and deep learning models, supported by academic research and impactful projects. My background spans predictive modeling, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, image processing, and data analysis, with proficiency in tools and languages such as Python, SQL, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn. I’ve developed and deployed AI solutions across various domains, particularly in healthcare and sentiment analysis, where I combined deep technical knowledge with innovative thinking. I’ve also contributed to a Q2 Scopus-indexed journal publication, and I am committed to applying AI in ways that are both technically rigorous and socially meaningful.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Heart Disease Prediction</strong> – <a href="https://github.com/jamilEmon/Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-ML-and-Deep-Learning" target="_blank">GitHub</a><br/>
        Developed a heart disease prediction model using RF, XGBoost, CatBoost, SVM, and 1D CNN. Achieved 96.36% accuracy with 1D CNN by applying advanced feature engineering and PCA. Boosted model performance by 7% through interaction-driven feature analysis and identified key health risk indicators.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hybrid Deep Ensemble for Sentiment Analysis</strong> – <a href="https://github.com/jamilEmon/Hybrid-Deep-Ensemble-for-Sentiment-Analysis" target="_blank">GitHub</a><br/>
        Built a hybrid sentiment analysis model combining BERT-based augmentation, transformer embeddings, ensemble learners, and a CNN-BiGRU-Attention network. Achieved 91.15% accuracy on Amazon reviews using stacking and Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Brain Tumor Classification</strong> – <a href="https://github.com/jamilEmon/Brain-Tumor-Classification-using-Deep-Learning" target="_blank">GitHub</a><br/>
        Developed a CNN pipeline leveraging transfer learning with VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0. Applied advanced image augmentation using Albumentations and achieved 97% accuracy through a stacking ensemble with logistic regression.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Airbnb-price-prediction</strong> – <a href="https://github.com/jamilEmon/Airbnb-price-prediction" target="_blank">GitHub</a><br/>
        This project builds a powerful Airbnb price prediction model using deep learning (Keras ANN) and ensemble methods like XGBoost, CatBoost, and Gradient Boosting. Strong feature engineering, log transformation, and a stacking ensemble achieved high accuracy with an R² up to 0.999.
